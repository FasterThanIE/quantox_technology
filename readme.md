# Hello #
I know I did not finish this task. Outputmodel.php is horrible, dirty code, I was stuck too much on Entities, I wanted to handle too many things over them and eventualy realised I dont have enough time left..
Didn't even have time to properly test this code. 

#MYSQL
All MySQL code is in "Mysql.sql"

#
GL, have fun!
